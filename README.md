IIC is shortcut for "Is it cracked". Project was created to repace crackwatch
and extend it's database for other types of software.

System requirments:
* Ruby 2.7.0 or higher
* Sqlite 3
* Node.js
* Rails 7.0.2

To run server I reccomend Linux Ubuntu or another distro that has apt
package manager (I've tried with pacman but there was problems with rails).
You can also use WSL if you like or install it on pure windows but I haven't
tested if they are working correctly.
