## About
IIC is shortcut for "Is it cracked". The project was created to replace crackwatch
and extend it's database for other types of software.

System requirments:
* Ruby 2.7.5 or higher
* Sqlite 3
* Node.js
* Rails 7.0.2

To run the server I recommend Linux Ubuntu or another distro that has apt
package manager (I've tried with pacman but there was problems with rails).
You can also use WSL if you like or install it on pure windows, but I haven't
tested if they are working correctly.

## Tests
Currently project was tested and is fully working on following systems:
* Linux Ubuntu 22 LTS
* Linux Mint 21
* Linux Ubuntu Server 22
* Void Linux

Warning! Project might work on other operating systems, but was not tested
and project creators might be unable to help you.
